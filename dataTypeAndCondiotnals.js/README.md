var is like let but "var" the original way of declaring variables in JS so you will see "var" at some point dont be confuse.

if (condition1) {
// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

precedence of logical operators is what will be run first

parameters == variable
arguments == value

A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function declaration (it’s a declaration time term).
An argument is the value that is passed to the function when it is called (it’s a call time term).

this is how functions work:

function (){ //declare function
do something
return something
}

call function
